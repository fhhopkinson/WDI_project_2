greenHub

greenHub is a place where those who care for their neighbourhood, their community, their country, their world, have the opportunity to create projects to 

The navigation of the site as a user:

The site's homepage holds images of the artists' profile pictures in a grid on the page with a conventional navbar. On click on the images will navigate to the artists' homepage so see their profile and the artist's portfolio of his work on a larger scale.

From the homepage there is a link to a gallery page which allows all of the art to be viewed in one place and also cintains the artists name and the description of the work. On click on the images it will take you to a  page of the piece alone to allow the image to be larger and the viewer to see more detail. On click on the image from here the user will navigate to the artists profile page. 

The navigation of the site as an artist:

In order for an artist to put his work on the site they must register which entails entering their details and their bio and porfile image into the fields and submit them into a database and this will create their profile page. From their profile page they will be able to add pieces of art by clickng on the link which will take them to a page where the blurb about the piece can be added and then the piece selected from the finder menu on the computer. This will populate the gallery area of the profile allowing the user to see the artists work.

How the site works:

The site works due to having two tables in the database, one of the artists details and one of the images and the details associated with them. The relationship between the two tables is the fundamental backbone behind the site. The images belong to particular artists and each artist has many images.

How it was designed:

The planning process was fundamental to the construction of the site as it determined the number of pages and the wireframes described what each page would look like. Furthermore, it schedule what to do when in order that it was completed on time allowing a day for bug fixing and tinkering on the last day.

The routes were organised and the number of models were defined though in this case I was intending for the user to be able to comment on the images in order to deliver feedback to the artist and to give other users guidance and opinions on the work that was presented. This was outside the MVP which was without styling meant to be finished on the Wednesday evening before the presentation on Friday.

The Design.

I decided that I ought to Keep It Simple Stupid in order that it not only looks like an art gallery in real life which white and minimal and clean but also as it would simplpify the styling and allowed me to use bootstrap which was designed for twitter and meant that for the artist profile and the gallery.

Conclusion

The site has not surpassed expectations but has fulfilled the brief for which I am grateful for the help and guidance of the instructors and the knowledge that they have imparted over half the course which allowed me to complete this project.
